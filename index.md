157,000 square-kilometers of airborne IfSAR data were flown summer of 2010. An additional 210,725 square-kilometers of restrictively licensed [IfSAR-derived DEM data collected in 2012](/assets/USGS-2012-Area1B_w_additions.jpg "USGS Alaksa IFSAR 2012 Acquisitions") will be uplifted into the public domain through this contract.

Dewberry is the prime contractor for the $6 million project being administered by the USGS through their GPSC vehicle. Fugro Earthdata and Intermap have each flown and processed half of the 2010 acquisitions. Major funding contributors include the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), State of Alaska, and USGS. Supporting contributors include the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and National Park Service.

These data consists of three products: Bare-earth DEM (DTM), Surface DEM (DSM), and an orthorectified radar intensity image (ORI).  The elevation models have a 5-meter post spacing, 22-foot contour equivalent accuracy, vertical accuracy of 3-meter LE90 (0-10 degree slope) and horizontal accuracy of 12.2-meter CE90.  

Additionally, Dewberry performed an edge-match along the 147th meridian where Intermap collected data to the east of this meridian and FEDI collected data to the west of this meridian.  The edge-match is documented in the report provided with each pair of edge-matched cells.  As the edge-match only affected four 15 minute tiles per cell, these folders only contain the tiles modified (no ORI data are included with these tiles).  The original, un-modified data along the 147th meridian is provided in the data organized by acquisition company.

All datasets have been processed and delivered in Alaska Albers Equal Area Conic (EPSG:3338), NAD83 horizontal datum and NAVD88 vertical datum.  The data includes FGDC Metadata, hydrologic enforcement, quality masks, and no more than 3% of void fill.
