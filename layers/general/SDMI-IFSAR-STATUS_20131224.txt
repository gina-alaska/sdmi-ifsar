A IFSAR cell status shapefile created and maintained by Dayne Broderson
and Pete Hickman at the Geographic Information Network of Alaska
http://gina.alaska.edu

We've just taken the various status shapefiles and status maps and put the
details Dayne cares about (what year was it collected, was it puchased) into
a single shapefile.
