A IFSAR cell status shapefile created and maintained by Dayne Broderson
at the Geographic Information Network of Alaska

I've just taken the various status shapefiles and status maps and put the
details I care about (what year was it collected, was it puchased) into
a single shapefile.

questions:  support@gina.alaska.edu
