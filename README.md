There are currently three major buckets of data tracked here:

Legacy IFSAR
------------

IFSAR flown and collected by Intermap in the early years.  All of
this data was uplifted to public domain for the 2010 IFSAR collection.

Legacy shapefile is found in: layers/legacy


2010 IFSAR Collection
---------------------

Interior of Alaska IFSAR collection split between two Fugro Earth Data 
and Intermap.  Majority of that collection has been purchased and delivered.

This shapefile is my attempt at organizing the status of all of 
the new SDMI IFSAR collections. 

You will need to use the 'year' attribute to determine what coverage 
is available.  The 2010 collection is all available right now and 
the 2012 collection will be available at the end of this year.
